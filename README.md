## About Bai Xu

> Introducing oneself is always a bit awkward. Because no matter what I say, it sounds like I'm shaping a person I "want to be," not necessarily the real me. In fact, each of us is like releasing a version update of "who I am" on social media, constantly trying to piece together our lives into a model that others can understand — although sometimes, even I don't understand this model myself. So, the question "Who am I" is one I still don't have an answer to. Philosophers have debated for thousands of years without clarifying it, and I can only think about it as I go along. Let's start with some less philosophical things. I hope they are like a window that allows you to see a me that is not just an avatar and a profile.
